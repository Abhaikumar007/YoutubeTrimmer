## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Under the Hood

This isn't just a simple script; it's a powerful combination of best-in-class tools:

1.  **`yt-dlp`**: The most robust and actively maintained tool for fetching video metadata and stream URLs from YouTube. It's the reliable backbone of our application.
2.  **`python-vlc`**: This library acts as a "remote control" for the powerful VLC Media Player, allowing us to embed a live video preview directly into our application window.
3.  **`ffmpeg`**: The undisputed champion of video manipulation. We call it directly to perform lightning-fast, lossless trims on video files.
4.  **`CustomTkinter`**: Provides the beautiful, modern graphical user interface (GUI).
